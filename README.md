# CS5344 Big-Data Analytics Technology - Final Project

Our group aims to perform sentiment analysis on conversational data using a combination of text and video features from the Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset (MELD). 

The MELD dataset is based on the popular TV series Friends, and includes data in text, audio, and visual modalities. It is an extension of the EmotionLines dataset. We will utilize only the text and visual modalities for this project. The original labeled dataset is available for download at https://affective-meld.github.io/, and is split into the train, dev, and test sets.
